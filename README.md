# EcoBrains Sensor

# Intro
This repository contains the source code for a waste analysis sensor system developed by @benjamin. 
The system integrates artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to automate waste classification processes for enterprises.

# Overview
The waste analysis sensor system is designed to analyze and classify various types of waste materials in real-time, 
providing accurate data to support waste management decisions. 
The system consists of a sensor device that collects waste data, processes it using machine learning algorithms, 
and transmits the results to a web server for analysis and storage.

# Features
Automated Waste Classification: The sensor system automates the process of waste classification using machine learning algorithms, reducing the need for manual intervention.
Real-time Data Analysis: Waste data is analyzed in real-time, providing up-to-date insights into waste composition and trends.
Secure Data Transmission: Data transmission between the sensor device and the web server is encrypted using AES encryption to ensure data security and privacy.
Flexible Reporting Schedule: The reporting schedule can be customized using environment variables, allowing for flexible reporting intervals based on operational needs.

# Usage
To use the waste analysis sensor system:

* Compile the Code: Compile the source code using a C compiler such as GCC.
* onfigure Environment Variables: Set environment variables for the reporting schedule and the URL of the web server portal.
* Deploy the Sensor System: Deploy the sensor system in the desired location for waste analysis.
* Monitor and Analyze Data: Monitor the sensor system's performance and analyze the collected data using the web server portal.
  
# Dependencies
The system relies on the following dependencies:

* [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON): A lightweight JSON parser for C.
* [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl): A library for transferring data with URLs.
